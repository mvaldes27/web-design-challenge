# web-design-challenge

- The elements of this repository create a visualization dashboard website using visualizations created with Matplotlib. 
There are individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. 
- These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is also a landing page, a page that shows comparison of all of the plots, and another page that shows the data used to build the visualizations. 
- Also included is a Jupyter notebook containing code to convert the dataset into HTML for website presentation.
